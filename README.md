# Business Structure

**LLC**
> An LLC or limited liability company is great if you’re a business-of-one or sole owner with just a couple employees. They’re easier to maintain than corporations and generally way more flexible. Plus, they’re the best choice if you own property for your business.
By default, an LLC is a “flow-through” entity, which means it pays taxes through an individual income tax code rather than through a corporate tax code. If you’re the sole owner of your LLC, you’ll automatically be a “disregarded entity” — which means your company doesn’t exist for tax purposes. But, (and this is where things get interesting), as an LLC you can choose to be taxed many different ways, and one of them is as an S corp.


**Sole-proprietorship**
> Prepare to get sued and lose everything you have



`Tax Classifications`

Both S and C corp is not a type of business. It’s a tax status, which is why you can technically be an LLC(entity) and an S corp(tax classification).

**S corp?**
> S corps are a less common type of corporation than a C corp but it has some major upsides for small, creative business. One of the reasons Bethany (and Collective) loves S corps is because of a little thing called social taxes. In most countries, including the U.S., we get charged social taxes on “earned wages.” (In the US, we call social taxes by many different names: FICA, payroll taxes, self-employment tax, social security and medicare, etc.) But, remember that when you’re a single-member LLC, your business, by default, doesn’t exist for tax purposes. That means that the IRS deems every dollar you make to be an “earned wage,” so you’re going to get that 15% social tax on everything. Choosing to be taxed as an S corp is your way of saying hold on, my business is more than just the hours I work. You’re telling the government that there are intangible assets associated with your business, like your knowledge, artistic signature, and brand. So, it’s not fair to say everything you earned is an “earned wage” because some of it is more like a return on investment.
> 
> What does this mean? If you have two identical businesses but one chooses to be taxed as an S corp and one chooses to stay an LLC, the LLC is paying the 15% social tax on all business profits and the S corp is pocketing most of that money. And that’s what generates the cash savings. In this scenario, “for every $100,000 your business earns, expect to save $12,000 to $15,000 on just social taxes alone,”

Because they are intended primarily for family-owned and other small businesses, S corporations are limited to no more than 100 investors (shareholders). When the number of shareholders in an S corporation exceeds the maximum allowed by law, the business must file and pay taxes as a C corporation.

**C-Corp?**

Facts  <br>
1.) It can have an unlimited number of owners and multiple classes of stock <br>
2.) must comply with many more federal and state requirements than an LLC. <br>
3.) Perpetual existence <br>
4.) Double taxation <br>
> Pays a flat federal income tax of 21% on everything (regardless of what state you live in)

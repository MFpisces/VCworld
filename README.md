### Content creator module <br>
### Youtube
 
- Dynamic CPM <br>
- Highest CPM's use to be toys, now it's finance  <br>
- If you swear in the 1st 2-5 mins of your video Youtube cuts ur CPM in half <br>
- Tags don’t carry weight, it’s more for research purposes to see what people are searching<br>

Ideally more is better in every sense of the word, you could pump out 3 videos a day and the viewership would still grow. A lot of streamers have full-time editors whose sole existence is to pump out videos on the daily. Youtube for the most part has very few limitations. Whenever you can afford to sustain paying an editor DO IT. 

Thumbnails ---> 2-3 focus points<br>
Story ---narrative --- direction <br>
Invoke a feeling<br>
Title and thumbnail should have different titles<br>
 * Highlights - moments from stream that are good current or past
 * Long Form - entire VODS, discussions, interviews etc. (you currently only do this category)
 * Meta/Reacts - reacting to things going on (present day, news)
Negotiation very hard to get a better CPM<br>
Average CPM = $6.50 11/20/20 <br>
Dislike/likes are both weighted equally for engagement<br>

### Twitch
- Flat-rate CPM
-
>Never run ads on Twitch the pay-per-view is horrendous and you will alienate your viewers. The marketing term is called “bounce-rate” and it basically means you're annoying, I’m outta here, dead content cya later. People will leave and most likely not return. It's 2020 you try to push anything onto anybody they are outta there. Pre-roll/mid-roll/end-roll ads DON’T DO IT!
You can take names from inactive accounts if you are a partner
Things you should know 
Display resolution 720 vs 1080 (33% more i vs 1440 (2k) vs 3840 (4k) <br>
Video encoding H.265 vs Nvenc (how they work, how are they different etc) <br>
Bitrate -how does pixel density/fps affect this <br>



How to pay an editor?
Video editors need to upload directly (get a % of youtube revenue or paid directly)<br>
Flat-rate Is generally accepted as the preferred method of paying an employee, but is not without its downsides. 


1. Due to a fixed income there is zero growth potential which is often very discouraging
2. No incentive to make quality videos
3. Typically unhappy with pay 
4. Potentially high turnover rate (Constantly looking for new editors)

With the exception of an agency/manager almost everybody should be paid this way, Anyone who tells you otherwise is out of their mind and most likely trying to take advantage of you. 

Revshare is simply a percentage-based payout which is very rarely used for obvious reasons. 

1. Unlimited growth potential
2. Performance-based
3. Almost always gets overpaid for very little effort.
4. Typically used by startups to help grow XYZ




Ok, great, now what?

The best thing you can do given your current situation is to actively try to find anybody willing to clip segments of your broadcasts for various kinds of content. On top of this, anybody willing to make VOD’s for Youtube and or act upon your content creation ideas like 

Types of content that is lowest hanging fruit 
Highlight reels
Fail compilations (Dotacinema)
Clips (A lot of streamers have a 2nd channel for this)
1st-time playthroughs (like your Remnants)
Commentary (watching pro dota/pro games etc)
Reacting andy (This is all Youtube was when it 1st started)

Types of content that is much harder
Cosplay
music 
art 
game shows
Podcasts
Reviews(food/products etc)
Travelling
there is typically a much greater creative and upfront cost that can be quite expensive. I’m sure this is the type of content you would enjoy the most given that these things are far more enjoyable than simply spitting out a highlight reel. Most Youtubers/streamers are actually extremely lazy, so really in-order to “make it” you just have to be less lazy than them smiley face


### Business module <br>
**How to setup an LLC** <br>
General talking points  <br>
>Use a service like LegalZoom and look for a resident agent and a state that doesn't have high state-tax (Washigton/Nevada/Texas).  <br>
You get a form from the government, you create shares(really easy) <br>
$125 to sumbit and $125 maintain roughly <br>
You get taxed where you work, legally obligated unless you can prove otherwise 

tax treaties<br>
For both US and Canada if you are outside the country for 300 + days (estimation) you don't get taxed (Tax loophole)
explain more later

Areas worth more money because the people have more money in them

Group A - United States/GB/Germay
Group B - 2nd world countries, Poland, parts of Asia
Group C- 3rd world / nobody buys shit here

# Business Structure

**LLC**
> An LLC or limited liability company is great if you’re a business-of-one or sole owner with just a couple employees. They’re easier to maintain than corporations and generally way more flexible. Plus, they’re the best choice if you own property for your business.
By default, an LLC is a “flow-through” entity, which means it pays taxes through an individual income tax code rather than through a corporate tax code. If you’re the sole owner of your LLC, you’ll automatically be a “disregarded entity” — which means your company doesn’t exist for tax purposes. But, (and this is where things get interesting), as an LLC you can choose to be taxed many different ways, and one of them is as an S corp.


**Sole-proprietorship**
> Prepare to get sued and lose everything you have



`Tax Classifications`

Both S and C corp is not a type of business. It’s a tax status, which is why you can technically be an LLC(entity) and an S corp(tax classification).

**S corp?**
> S corps are a less common type of corporation than a C corp but it has some major upsides for small, creative business. One of the reasons Bethany (and Collective) loves S corps is because of a little thing called social taxes. In most countries, including the U.S., we get charged social taxes on “earned wages.” (In the US, we call social taxes by many different names: FICA, payroll taxes, self-employment tax, social security and medicare, etc.) But, remember that when you’re a single-member LLC, your business, by default, doesn’t exist for tax purposes. That means that the IRS deems every dollar you make to be an “earned wage,” so you’re going to get that 15% social tax on everything. Choosing to be taxed as an S corp is your way of saying hold on, my business is more than just the hours I work. You’re telling the government that there are intangible assets associated with your business, like your knowledge, artistic signature, and brand. So, it’s not fair to say everything you earned is an “earned wage” because some of it is more like a return on investment.
> 
> What does this mean? If you have two identical businesses but one chooses to be taxed as an S corp and one chooses to stay an LLC, the LLC is paying the 15% social tax on all business profits and the S corp is pocketing most of that money. And that’s what generates the cash savings. In this scenario, “for every $100,000 your business earns, expect to save $12,000 to $15,000 on just social taxes alone,”

Because they are intended primarily for family-owned and other small businesses, S corporations are limited to no more than 100 investors (shareholders). When the number of shareholders in an S corporation exceeds the maximum allowed by law, the business must file and pay taxes as a C corporation.

**C-Corp?** <br>
Facts
> 1.) It can have an unlimited number of owners and multiple classes of stock <br>
2.) must comply with many more federal and state requirements than an LLC. <br>
3.) Perpetual existence <br>
4.) Double taxation <br>
> Pays a flat federal income tax of 21% on everything (regardless of what state you live in) - soon to be 28% if Biden's provision passes
